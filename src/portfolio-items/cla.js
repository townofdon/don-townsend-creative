    `
    [Christian Light Publications](https://www.clp.org/) enlisted [Chiedo Labs](https://labs.chiedo.com) to rebuild their system for tracking student academic
    progress for home-school families. They needed the app to be accessible anywhere in the world,
    and they wanted it to be built using modern technologies.
    `,
    `
    We built our own Node.js framework for the API, including CLI tooling to speed up development.
    We used React and Redux on the front-end for a dynamic, interactive UI.
    `,
    `
    My roles in the project included project management, team lead, lead back-end developer
    as well as lead front-end developer.
